This is SlySven's fork of the master repository held on SourceForge.

Primary target for myself is GNU/Linux OS on Debian Stable (Wheezy).

Current Status:
    Builds cleanly with Qt5.1 libraries & recent Qt Creator (IDE).
        Shadow building (building object files away from src directory)
        NOT supported (yet!) - LUA subsystem fails to find required files at
        runtime...

    May NOT execute properly - in process of uploading cherry-picked parts of
    recently done development and it is possible that I have dropped one or
    two fruits at this point 8-) !

Run-time issue known about: had added a different icon for "Fullscreen" view
    toolbar button for use on small screen set-up but forgot to incorporate
    it into resource (mudlet_alpha.qrc) file.  Will fix in a commit or two.
