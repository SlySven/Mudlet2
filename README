This is SlySven's fork of the master repository held on SourceForge.

Primary target for myself is GNU/Linux OS on Debian Stable (Wheezy).

Current Status:   Buildable
        *** Mac build not working (upstream was bad at fork) ***
        *** CMake project build system badly out of date ***

Current build environment: Qt5.1 libraries & recent Qt Creator (IDE).
        Shadow building (building object files away from src directory)
        NOT supported (yet!) - LUA subsystem fails to find required files at
        runtime...

Recent Changes:

* Enhanced Room Exits GUI.

* Enhanced Custom Line Exit GUI and 2D Map editing capabilities.

* project files (src.pro & mac_src.pro) cleaned up and brought up to date.

* #include files usage changed to use forward declaration of Mudlet classes
  where possible to reduce recompilation times if a project header file
  modfied. Included headers also migrated from .h to corresponding .cppi
  where possible.

* Centralised control of version information.  Added myself to About dialog.
  Inserted a full formatted copy of the GPL (Version 3) to the About dialog.

* Added some needed lua commands for manipulating Map's Room user-data.
