This is SlySven's fork of the master repository held on SourceForge.

Primary target for myself is GNU/Linux OS on Debian Stable (Wheezy).

Current Status:
    Builds cleanly with Qt5.1 libraries & recent Qt Creator (IDE).
        Shadow building (building object files away from src directory)
        NOT supported (yet!) - LUA subsystem fails to find required files at
        runtime...

Recent Changes:

* Enhanced Room Exits GUI.

* (Now working) Enhanced Custom Line Exit GUI and 2D Map editing capabilities.
