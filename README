This is SlySven's fork of the master repository held on SourceForge.

Primary target for myself is GNU/Linux OS on Debian Stable (Wheezy).

Current Status:   *** Not confirmed to build ***

Current build environment: Qt5.1 libraries & recent Qt Creator (IDE).
        Shadow building (building object files away from src directory)
        NOT supported (yet!) - LUA subsystem fails to find required files at
        runtime...

Recent Changes:

* Enhanced Room Exits GUI.

* Enhanced Custom Line Exit GUI and 2D Map editing capabilities.

* project files (src.pro & mac_src.pro) cleaned up and brought up to date.

* #include files usage changed to use forward declaration of Mudlet classes
  where possible to reduce recompilation times if a project header file modfied.
  Included headers also migrated from .h to corresponding .cpp where possible.
